# Welcome to FoundML

FoundML helps you handle machine learning in production


 - **Project management**. Regroup algorithms that operate on the same data and work to achieve the same goal.
 - **AB test for free**. Use algorithm policies that let you test algorithms (Single Algorithm, Round Robin).
 - **Predictions and Examples**. Generate predictions and associate labels very simply in production to easily generate datasets.
 - **Data streaming**. Every predictions gets published to your data streaming platform (Amazon Kinesis).

To learn more about how FoundML can help you improve your machine learning in production, see [Getting Started](getting_started.html).
