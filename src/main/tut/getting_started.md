# Getting Started

FoundaML will help you industrialize your machine learning projects. It sits between your clients (web apps, mobile apps etc) and your algorithms (heuristics or machine learning).

FoundaML has four key concepts.

### Projects
A project is a set of algorithms working on the same data. 
The principle here is that you can compare and switch algorithms only if they operate on the same data.

That is why, when you use FoundaML, you start by defining your project, the data that it will work on and the objective it will pursue. For the moment, FoundaML supports the following types of problems.

* Classification

FoundaML supports a set of generic features that you can combine to build any algorithm, those include.

* Double or Float
* Integer
* String
