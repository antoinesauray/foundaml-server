# Foundaml
For machine learning foundations, is a service that enables machine learning predictions to be stored, predicted and associated to their labels.

Many machine learning projects fail due to bad handling of data. Foundaml helps you to manage your machine learning pipeline and to develop successful machine learning projects.

## Predict
Foundaml does not execute algorithms on its own. It needs to be paired with other software, such as TensorFlow Serving, to be able to generate predictions.

## Generate examples
Each prediction is identified uniquely. Whenever true data is generated (by a human), you can associate the correct label to the prediction.

## Train models
Forget about SQL, use our own sets of data consumers to train algorithms. Store them in the cloud and ship them with ease.
